          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>Image processing plays a crucial role in remote sensing, enabling the transformation of raw satellite or airborne imagery into meaningful information about the 
            Earth's surface.</p>
          <p>Remote sensing image processing involves analyzing and enhancing images acquired from distant sources, such as satellites or aerial platforms. 
            This includes tasks like correcting distortions, improving resolution, and extracting meaningful information from the imagery. Techniques like
            radiometric and geometric corrections, image classification, and feature extraction are commonly employed to derive valuable insights from remote 
            sensing data. Advanced methods may also involve machine learning algorithms for automated analysis and interpretation of the images.</p><br>

            <h3><strong>Key steps envolved in image processing: </strong></h3>
            <p>The process of image processing in remote sensing involves several key steps:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Preprocessing:</strong></li>
                <p>This is the initial stage in remote sensing image analysis, as it prepares the raw imagery for subsequent processing and analysis. 
                  Pre-processing tasks, also known as image restoration and rectification, aim to address radiometric and geometric distortions specific 
                  to sensors and platforms. Radiometric corrections become essential to account for changes in scene illumination, viewing angles, atmospheric 
                  conditions, and sensor characteristics like noise and response. These corrections vary based on the particular sensor, platform, and conditions 
                  during data acquisition. Additionally, converting or calibrating the data to absolute radiation or reflectance units is often desirable for 
                  facilitating data comparison. 
                  
                  <p><strong>How do we know the incoming signal to sensors are scattered or not?</strong>
                    <p>Radiation undergoes scattering as it traverses and engages with the atmosphere. This scattering has the effect of reduce or attenuate 
                      a portion of the energy that reaches the surface. Moreover, the atmosphere contributes to further attenuation of the signal traveling from the 
                      target to the sensor. Atmospheric correction can be approached through diverse methods, spanning from intricate modeling of atmospheric conditions 
                      during data acquisition to straightforward calculations based solely on the image data. This is achieved by applying <strong>mathematical models</strong> 
                      and <strong>resampling techniques</strong> to align the image with a reference map or coordinate system. In remote sensing, distinguishing between 
                      scattered and non-scattered signals, as well as assessing the impact of atmospheric conditions on signal attenuation, involves various techniques:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Radiative Transfer Models: </strong> Mathematical models, such as radiative transfer models, simulate the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with the atmosphere. By comparing observed and modeled data, researchers can infer the atmospheric effects and assess whether the signal has undergone scattering or attenuation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Spectral Analysis:</strong> Analyzing the spectral characteristics of the acquired data can provide insights into atmospheric conditions. Certain wavelengths are more susceptible to scattering, and the analysis of spectral signatures can help identify whether the signal has been scattered.</li>
                        <li><strong>Calibration Targets: </strong>Placing calibrated targets in the scene or using natural features with known reflectance properties can serve as reference points. By comparing the expected and observed signal values, researchers can infer the impact of atmospheric conditions on signal attenuation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ancillary Data: </strong>Utilizing ancillary data, such as meteorological information, can aid in understanding and modeling atmospheric conditions during data acquisition. This information helps in correcting or adjusting the observed signal for atmospheric effects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Historical Data and Trends: </strong>Examining historical data and observing trends in signal behavior over time can provide valuable insights. Changes in signal characteristics that correlate with specific atmospheric conditions may indicate scattering or attenuation effects.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ground-Based Measurements: </strong>Conducting ground-based measurements, such as using instruments to directly measure atmospheric parameters, helps validate and improve atmospheric correction models.</li>
                      </ul>
                  </p><br>
                  
                  Here's a breakdown of the key steps involved in image preprocessing for remote sensing:</p>
                <li style="list-style-type: none; background-color: rgb(206, 228, 235); border: 1px solid rgb(116, 110, 110); margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                    <ol style="list-style: none; padding: 0;">
                        <li style="background-color: white; border: 1px solid rgb(26, 25, 25); margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 10px;">
                            <h5><strong>Geometric Correction:</strong></h5> 
                            <p>Geometric corrections address distortions caused by the Earth's curvature, satellite orbit, and sensor tilt, ensuring that the 
                            image accurately represents the true geometry of the Earth's surface.  This correction becomes necessary 
                            to facilitate comparisons between images captured by various sensors on different dates or times. It also proves useful when mosaicking 
                            multiple images from a single sensor while ensuring consistent illumination conditions across scenes.</p>

                            <p>Here's an overview of how geometric correction is typically done:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Ground Control Points (GCPs) Collection:</strong>
                                    <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 30px;">
                                        <li>Identify distinct and easily identifiable features in the image and corresponding locations on the Earth's surface.</li>
                                        <li>These features, known as Ground Control Points (GCPs), serve as reference points for the correction process.</li>
                                        <li>The geometric registration process involves identifying the image coordinates (i.e. row, column) of several clearly discernible points, 
                                          called GCPs, in the distorted image, and matching them to their true positions in ground coordinates (e.g. latitude, longitude). </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Coordinate Transformation:</strong>
                                    <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 30px;">
                                        <li>Use the GCPs to perform a coordinate transformation that relates pixel coordinates in the image to geographic coordinates on the Earth's surface.</li>
                                        <li>Common transformations include polynomial transformations (e.g., polynomial of the first or second order) or affine transformations.</li>
                                        <li><strong>Mathematical Models:</strong>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Polynomial Correction:</strong> This method utilizes polynomial equations of various degrees to model the distortions in the image. 
                                                The coefficients of the polynomial are determined by fitting the model to ground control points (GCPs) or reference imagery. Polynomial 
                                                correction is a versatile approach that can handle a wide range of distortions, including geometric shifts, scale variations, and skew.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Rational Function Model (RFM):</strong> The RFM is a more sophisticated mathematical model that represents the image coordinates as 
                                                a rational function of the ground coordinates. This model is particularly useful for correcting distortions caused by satellite orbit, sensor 
                                                orientation, and elevation.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Triangulation-Based Correction:</strong> This method divides the image into triangles and applies transformations to each triangle to 
                                                align it with a reference frame. The transformations are determined using GCPs or other reference data. This approach is particularly well-suited 
                                                for images with significant local distortions.</li>
                                        </ul></li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Resampling: </strong>
                                    <ul style="list-style-type: circle; margin-left: 30px;">
                                        <li>In georeferencing or geocorrection processes in remote sensing, resampling is a key step to correct distorted images. The purpose of resampling is to transform the pixel values from the original image to a new set of coordinates, aligning them with a specified map projection or coordinate system.</li>
                                        <figure style="text-align: center;">
                                          <img src="assets/img/remote-sensing/geometric-correction.png" alt="" style="max-width: 70%; max-height: 70%;">
                                      </figure>     
                                        <li><strong>Mathematical models:</strong>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li><strong>Nearest Neighbor Resampling:</strong>  In Nearest Neighbor Resampling, for each pixel in the corrected image, the digital value is directly taken from the pixel in the original image that is closest to its new location.
                                                    It is a computationally efficient method but can result in jagged edges and loss of detail.</li>
                                                <li><strong>Bilinear Interpolation:</strong> In Bilinear Interpolation Resampling, for each new pixel in the corrected image, a weighted average is calculated 
                                                  based on the values of four pixels in the original image that are nearest to the new pixel's location. 
                                                  These four nearest pixels form a square or rectangle around the new pixel, and their values contribute to the calculation of the new pixel's value. 
                                                  The averaging process alters the original pixel values and creates entirely new digital values in the output image. This may be undesirable if further
                                                  processing and analysis, such as classification based on spectral response, is to be done. If this is the case, resampling may best be done after

                                Radiometric correction is a crucial step in remote sensing image processing, as it transforms raw digital numbers (DNs) recorded by a satellite 
                                sensor into calibrated radiance or reflectance values that accurately represent the physical properties of the Earth's surface. 
                                The process involves applying mathematical equations to compensate for various factors that affect the sensor's recorded signal. 
                                Radiometric calibration aims to convert DNs into radiance values by accounting for the sensor's gain (sensitivity) and offset (bias). 
                                This process can be represented mathematically as:
                                $$\text{Radiance} = (\text{DN} - \text{Offset}) \times \text{Gain}. $$

                                Solar irradiance correction normalizes radiance values by dividing them by the solar irradiance at the time of image acquisition. This accounts for 
                                variations in solar energy reaching the Earth's surface due to changes in solar-Earth distance and atmospheric effects. The solar irradiance correction

                                normalized radiance values to isolate the reflected radiation from the Earth's surface. The path radiance correction equation is:
                                $$\text{Corrected Radiance} = \text{Normalized Radiance} - \text{Path Radiance}.$$

                                The final step in radiometric correction is to convert the corrected radiance values to TOA reflectance. TOA reflectance represents the proportion of solar irradiance reflected by the Earth's surface and 
                                scattered by the atmosphere to the satellite sensor. The conversion equation is:

                                <li><strong>Frequency Filtering: </strong> Frequency filtering involves transforming the image from the spatial domain to the frequency domain using techniques like Fourier transform or wavelet 
                                    transform. Noise is often concentrated in specific frequency ranges, allowing for its removal by applying filter masks or thresholding techniques in the frequency domain <sup>[]</sup>.</li>
                                <li><strong>Temporal Filtering: </strong>Temporal filtering utilizes multiple images acquired at different times to reduce noise. By averaging or differencing images acquired over time, 
                                    random noise can be reduced while preserving persistent features <sup>[7, 8]</sup>.</li>
                                <li><strong>Adaptive Filters: </strong>Adaptive filters adjust their filtering parameters based on local image characteristics, allowing them to effectively reduce noise while preserving

                                <li><strong>Wavelet-Based Filters: </strong>Wavelet-based filtering utilizes wavelets, which are mathematical functions that decompose an image into different frequency scales. Noise can 
                                    be selectively removed from different wavelet levels, preserving the desired information content <sup>[11,12]</sup>.</li>
                                <li><strong>Machine Learning-Based Noise Reduction: </strong>Machine learning algorithms, such as <em>convolutional neural networks (CNNs)</em>, can be trained to identify and remove noise patterns 
                                    in images. These algorithms can learn from large datasets of noisy and noise-free images, making them effective for various noise types <sup>[13, 14]</sup>.</li>

                    <p style="color: rgb(22, 19, 19);">Image preprocessing plays a fundamental role in remote sensing image analysis, ensuring that the processed imagery accurately represents the Earth's surface 
                        and provides reliable information for further analysis and interpretation. The specific preprocessing steps employed depend on the characteristics of the 
                        imagery, the sensor used, and the specific application.</p>

                <li><h5><strong>Image Enhancement:</strong></h5> </li>
                    Image enhancement techniques are used to improve the visual quality of the image, making it easier to interpret and analyze. This may involve 
                    techniques such as contrast stretching, histogram equalization, and edge detection, which can enhance the visibility of features and make subtle variations more apparent.<br>

                      <p>In raw imagery, the useful data often populates only a small portion of the available range of digital values (commonly 8 bits or 256 levels). Contrast enhancement involves changing the 
                        original values so that more of the available range is used, thereby increasing the contrast between targets and their backgrounds. The key to understanding contrast enhancements is to 
                        understand the concept of an image histogram. A histogram is a graphical representation of the brightness values that comprise an image. The brightness values (i.e. 0-255) are displayed 
                        along the x-axis of the graph. The frequency of occurrence of each of these values in the image is shown on the y-axis. </p>

                          <figcaption style="text-align: left;">In the above unenhanced image (first panel), a bluish tint can be seen all-over the image, producing a hazy apapearance. This hazy appearance is due to 
                              scattering of sunlight by atmosphere into the field of view of the sensor. This effect also degrades the contrast between different landcovers. 
                              It is useful to examine the image Histograms before performing any image enhancement. The x-axis of the histogram is the range of the available digital numbers, i.e. 0 to 255. 
                              The y-axis is the number of pixels in the image having a given digital number. The histograms of the three bands of this image is shown in the following figures.
                              Note that the minimum digital number for each band is not zero. Each histogram is shifted to the right by a certain amount. This shift is due to the atmospheric scattering 
                              component adding to the actual radiation reflected from the ground. The shift is particular large for the histogram of the green band, compared to the other two bands due to the higher 
                              contribution from Rayleigh scattering for the shorter wavelength. The maximum digital number of each band is also not 255. The sensor's gain factor has been adjusted to anticipate any 
                              possibility of encountering a very bright object. Hence, most of the pixels in the image have digital numbers well below the maximum value of 255.

                          <figcaption style="text-align: left;">The image can be enhanced by a simple linear grey-level stretching. In this method, a level threshold 
                              value is chosen so that all pixel values below this threshold are mapped to zero. An upper threshold value is also chosen so that 
                              all pixel values above this threshold are mapped to 255. All other pixel values are linearly interpolated to lie between 0 and 255. 
                              The lower and upper thresholds are usually chosen to be values close to the minimum and maximum pixel values of the image.

                <li><strong>Feature Extraction:</strong> Feature extraction in remote sensing refers to the process of identifying and isolating specific objects or characteristics within an image that 
                  are of interest for analysis or interpretation. The goal is to transform raw pixel data into meaningful information about the landscape. <br>

                    <li>The primary objectives include identifying and delineating objects or regions in the image that represent distinct features like roads, buildings, vegetation, water bodies, etc.</li>
                    <li>Feature extraction is crucial for applications such as land cover mapping, urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster assessment.</li>
