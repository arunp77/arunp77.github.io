                <h3>What Is a Data Model?</h3>
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px;">
                <li>A data model is a conceptual representation of data that defines the structure, relationships, and constraints of data elements within a system or organization. 
                    It serves as a blueprint for how data is organized and stored, allowing for efficient data management, retrieval, and analysis.</li>
                <li>Data models are visual representations of an enterprise’s data elements and the connections between them. By helping to define and structure 
                    data in the context of relevant business processes, models support the development of effective information systems. They enable business and 
                    technical resources to collaboratively decide how data will be stored, accessed, shared, updated and leveraged across an organization.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What is the purpose of a data model?</h3>
                <div style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px; text-align: center;">
                  <img src="assets/img/portfolio/data-model-goal.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;">
                </div>
                <p>Data models play a key role in bringing together all segments of an enterprise – IT, business analysts, management and others – to cooperatively design 
                    information systems (and the databases they rely on). These systems require properly defined and formatted data, and models shine a clear light on what 
                    data is required and how it must be structured to support the desired business processes.
                    By explicitly determining the structure of your data, these models support a variety of use cases, including database modeling, information system 
                    design, and process development in support of a consistent, clean exchange of data. It’s also important to understand the three different types of data models. 
                    Each will serve a different purpose as you work through the data modeling process. The purposes of a data model are as follows:</p>  
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px;">
                    <li><strong>Structural Clarity:</strong> It provides a clear and organized structure for data, defining how data entities (e.g., customers, products) are 
                        related to each other and how attributes (e.g., names, IDs) are organized.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Data models enforce constraints and rules that ensure data accuracy and consistency. This helps in preventing data 
                        anomalies and errors.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Management:</strong> Data models assist in data storage, retrieval, and management. They define how data is stored in databases, making 
                        it easier to work with data efficiently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Data models act as a common language between business stakeholders, analysts, and developers, facilitating clear 
                        communication about data requirements and structures.</li>
                    <li><strong>Analysis and Reporting:</strong> They enable data analysts and scientists to perform complex queries, analytics, and reporting, as they 
                        understand how data is organized.</li>
                    <li><strong>Database Design:</strong> Data models are used in the design of databases and data warehouses, helping in the creation of tables, indexes, 
                        and relationships.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Types of data models</h3>
                    <p>There are several types of data models, including:</p>
                    <div style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px; text-align: center;">
                      <img src="assets/img/portfolio/data-model.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;">
                    </div>


                    <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px;">
                    <li><strong>Conceptual Data Model:</strong> This provides a high-level (big-picture view), abstract view of the data in an organization, focusing on entities and their 
                        relationships without delving into technical details.</li>
                        <img src="assets/img/portfolio/conceptual-data-modeling.png" alt="" style="max-width: 900px; max-height: 800px;">
                    <li><strong>Logical Data Model:</strong> It defines data structures in a more detailed manner, including entities, attributes, and their relationships. 
                        It is technology-independent and focuses on what needs to be stored.</li>
                        <img src="assets/img/portfolio/logical-data-modeling.png" alt="" style="max-width: 900px; max-height: 800px;">
                    <li><strong>Physical Data Model:</strong> They provide a schema for how the data will be physically stored within a database. As such, they’re the least 
                        abstract of all. They offer a finalized design that can be implemented as a relational database, including associative tables that illustrate the 
                        relationships among entities as well as the primary keys and foreign keys that will be used to maintain those relationships. Physical data models 
                        can include database management system (DBMS)-specific properties, including performance tuning.</li>
                        <img src="assets/img/portfolio/physical-data-modeling.png" alt="" style="max-width: 900px; max-height: 800px;">
                    <li><strong>Hierarchical Data Model:</strong> It organizes data in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships, where each parent can have 
                        multiple children but each child can have only one parent.</li>
                        <img src="assets/img/portfolio/hierarcial-model.png" alt="" style="max-width: 800px; max-height: 700px;">
                    <li><strong>Network Data Model:</strong> It extends the hierarchical model by allowing multiple relationships between records, providing more flexibility.
                        Instead of only allowing each child to have one parent, this model allows each child to have multiple parents (it calls the children members and the 
                        parents owners). It addresses the need to model more complex relationships such as the orders/parts many-to-many relationship mentioned in the 
                        hierarchical article. In following figure, A1 has two members, B1 and B2. B1. is the owner of C1, C2, C3 and C4. However, in this model, 
                        C4 has two owners, B1 and B2. </li>
                    <img src="assets/img/portfolio/network_model.png" alt="" style="max-width: 900px; max-height: 800px;">
                    <li><strong>Relational Data Model:</strong> It represents data as tables with rows and columns, where each table has a primary key and can be related to 
                        other tables through foreign keys. It's the foundation for relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.</li>
                        <img src="assets/img/portfolio/relational-data-model.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 900px; max-height: 800px;">
                    <li><strong>Entity-Relationship Model (ERD):</strong> Entity relationship diagram describes the structure of the database. The entity relationship 
                        diagram shows entities (tables in relational databases) and relationships between tables that exist in the database. For a good database design, 
                        it is very important to have an entity relationship diagram. In an entity relationship diagram, the basic elements are:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Entities (tables)</li>
                            <li>Attributes (table columns)</li>
                            <li>Relationships (relationships between tables)</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <div style="max-width: 1200px; max-height: 900px; text-align: center;">

                             In this project, I created a comprehensive school data model, 
                            encompassing various critical elements such as class data, staff members, staff salaries, school details, addresses, parent 
                            information, student profiles, and subject details. This model serves as the foundation for organizing and managing crucial 
                            data related to the school environment. If you believe additional information would be beneficial, please feel free to suggest 
                            any specific details you'd like me to include.

                      <h3>Benefits of data modeling</h3>
                      <p>Data modeling makes it easier for developers, data architects, business analysts, and other stakeholders to view and understand relationships among the data in a database or data warehouse. In addition, it can:</p>

                        <li>Reduce errors in software and database development.</li>
                        <li>Increase consistency in documentation and system design across the enterprise.</li>
                        <li>Improve application and database performance.</li>
                        <li>Ease data mapping throughout the organization.</li>
                        <li>Improve communication between developers and business intelligence teams.</li>
                        <li>Ease and speed the process of database design at the conceptual, logical and physical levels.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <h3>Data modeling process</h3>
                      <p>The data modeling process involves designing and creating a conceptual representation of how data should be organized, structured, and stored in a database system. It typically consists of the following steps:</p>
                      <ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 30px;">
                        <li><strong>Identify Requirements: </strong>Understand the requirements of the system or application for which the data model is being developed. This involves gathering information from stakeholders, business analysts, and subject matter experts to determine the entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints that need to be represented.</li>
                        <li><strong>Conceptual Data Model: </strong>Create a conceptual data model that represents the high-level entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them. The conceptual model focuses on the business or domain concepts and provides an abstract view of the data requirements. Common techniques for creating conceptual models include entity-relationship (ER) diagrams or object-oriented models.</li>
                        <li><strong>Normalize the Model (Optional):</strong>If working with a relational database, the conceptual model can be normalized to eliminate redundancies and improve data integrity. This step involves applying normalization rules to ensure data is organized efficiently and avoid data anomalies. Normalization involves decomposing entities and defining primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships.</li>
                        <li><strong>Logical Data Model: </strong>Transform the conceptual model into a logical data model. The logical model represents the data structures and relationships using a specific notation or language. For relational databases, this often involves creating tables, defining columns, specifying data types, and establishing relationships using primary and foreign keys. In other database models, such as document-oriented or graph databases, the logical model may have different representations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Validate and Refine: </strong>Review and validate the logical data model to ensure it accurately represents the requirements. Collaborate with stakeholders to verify the model's correctness and completeness. Make refinements and adjustments as necessary to address any inconsistencies or issues identified during the validation process.</li>
                        <li><strong>Physical Data Model: </strong>Convert the logical data model into a physical data model that considers the specific database management system (DBMS) being used. This step involves translating the logical model into the technical implementation details, including specific database structures, indexes, storage considerations, and optimization techniques. The physical data model reflects the technical specifications required for data storage and retrieval.</li>
                        <li><strong>Implement and Deploy: </strong>Once the physical data model is finalized, it serves as the blueprint for implementing the database schema in the chosen DBMS. Create the necessary database objects (tables, indexes, views, etc.) based on the physical model. Load the data into the database and ensure that it aligns with the defined model.</li>
                      </ul>
