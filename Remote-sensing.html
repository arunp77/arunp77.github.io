    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Remote sensing is the science of acquiring information about an object or phenomenon without being in direct contact with it. 
        It is a vast and complex field, with applications in many different disciplines, including geology, geography, environmental 
        science, agriculture, forestry, and hydrology.</p>

    <h4>How does remote sensing work?</h4>
    <p>Remote sensing works by measuring the energy that is emitted or reflected from an object. The energy can be in the form of visible light, infrared radiation, radar 
      signals, or other forms of electromagnetic radiation. The energy is then recorded and processed to create images or other data products that can be used to interpret the properties of the object.</p>

      <h4>Satellite Characteristics: Orbits and Swaths </h4>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Orbits: </strong>
          Satellites play a crucial role in various applications, including remote sensing, communication, and Earth observation. Two key characteristics defining satellite behavior are their orbits and swaths (for more detaills on various orbits, check the <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/OrbitsCatalog" target="_blank">link</a>).

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Low Earth Orbit (LEO):</strong>
              <ul>
                  <li>Satellites in LEO orbit close to Earth, typically at altitudes ranging from about 180 to 2,000 kilometers.</li>
                  <li>LEO satellites offer advantages for remote sensing, providing high-resolution imagery and frequent revisits due to their shorter orbital periods.</li>
                  <li>Examples of LEO remote sensing satellites include the <a href="https://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">Landsat series</a> and the 
                    <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/international-space-station/" target="_blank"> International Space Station (ISS)</a>.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>          
            <li><strong>Medium Earth Orbit (MEO):</strong>
              <ul>
                  <li>MEO satellites orbit at intermediate altitudes, typically between 2,000 and 35,786 kilometers.</li>
                  <li>These orbits provide a balance between coverage and resolution, making them suitable for a variety of applications, including navigation systems like GPS.</li>
                  <li>Examples of MEO satellites include those in the <a href="https://www.gps.gov/systems/gnss/" target="_blank">Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)</a> constellations.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>          
            <li><strong>Geostationary Orbit (GEO):</strong>
              <ul>
                  <li>GEO satellites are positioned at approximately 35,786 kilometers above the equator, allowing them to appear stationary relative to a fixed point on Earth.</li>
                  <li>These satellites provide continuous coverage of a specific region, making them ideal for applications like weather monitoring and communication.</li>
                  <li>Examples include weather satellites like <a href="https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/goes/index.php" target="_blank"> GOES</a> (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Polar Orbit:</strong>
              <ul>
                  <li>Satellites in polar orbits pass over Earth's poles, providing global coverage with each orbit.</li>
                  <li>These orbits are well-suited for Earth observation missions, as they cover the entire surface over time.</li>

        <li><strong>Swaths: </strong>
          <p>The swath width refers to the coverage area on the Earth's surface captured by a satellite during a single pass. It is determined by the satellite's sensor characteristics and the satellite's altitude. A wider swath allows for broader coverage but may sacrifice image resolution.</p>
          <p>Understanding the interplay between orbits and swaths is essential for optimizing satellite mission design. LEO satellites, for instance, may have smaller swaths but offer higher revisit frequencies, making them suitable for applications requiring frequent observations. GEO satellites, on the other hand, have a fixed view but cover a larger area with each pass, making them ideal for continuous monitoring.</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Key Elements of the Remote Sensing Process: From Energy Source to Application</strong>
        <p>In remote sensing, the interaction between incident radiation and the targets of interest is a common process. This is illustrated in imaging systems, which encompass seven key elements. 
          It's important to recognize that remote sensing also includes the detection of emitted energy and the utilization of non-imaging sensors. 
        </p>
        <img src="assets/img/remote-sensing/Active-passive.png" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;">
        <br><br>
        
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Energy source or Illumination (A):</strong> The first requirement for remote sensing is to have
            an energy source which illuminates or provides electromagnetic energy to the target
            of interest</li>
          <li><strong>Radiation and the Atmosphere (B) - </strong> as the energy travels from its source to the
            target, it will come in contact with and interact with the atmosphere it passes through. This
            interaction may take place a second time as the energy travels from the target to the sensor.</li>
          <li><strong>Interaction with the Target (C) - </strong>once the energy makes its way to the target through the
            atmosphere, it interacts with the target depending on the properties of both the target and the
            radiation.</li>
          <li><strong>Recording of Energy by the Sensor (D)  - </strong> after the energy has been scattered by, or
            emitted from the target, we require a sensor (remote - not in contact with the target) to collect
            and record the electromagnetic radiation. </li>
          <li><strong>Transmission, Reception, and Processing (E) - </strong>the energy recorded by the sensor has
            to be transmitted, often in electronic form, to a receiving and processing station where the
            data are processed into an image (hardcopy and/or digital)</li>
          <li><strong>Interpretation and Analysis (F) - </strong>the processed image is interpreted, visually and/or
            digitally or electronically, to extract information about the target which was illuminated. 
            </li>
          <li><strong>Application (G) - </strong>the final element of the remote sensing process is achieved when we
            apply the information we have been able to extract from the imagery about the target in order
            to better understand it, reveal some new information, or assist in solving a particular problem. </li>

      </li> 
      <li><strong>Components of Remote Sensing: </strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Interaction of Electromagnetic Radiation:</strong> Before radiation used for remote sensing reaches the Earth's surface, it has to travel through some distance of the Earth's atmosphere. Particles and gases in the atmosphere can affect the incoming light and radiation. These effects are caused by the mechanisms of scattering and absorption.</li>

          </figure>
        
          <ol style="list-style-type: upper-roman;">
            <li><strong>Scattering:</strong> Scattering occurs when particles or large gas molecules present in the atmosphere interact with and cause the electromagnetic radiation to be redirected from its original path. How much scattering takes place depends on several factors including the wavelength of the radiation, the abundance of particles or gases, and the distance the radiation travels through the atmosphere. There are three (3) types of scattering which take place.
              <figure style="text-align: center;">

              </figure>
              <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
                <li><strong>Rayleigh scattering:</strong> Rayleigh scattering occurs when particles are significantly smaller than the wavelength of radiation, such as tiny dust particles or nitrogen and oxygen molecules. This phenomenon causes shorter wavelengths of energy to scatter more than longer wavelengths. In the upper atmosphere, Rayleigh scattering is the predominant mechanism. The daytime sky appears blue because, as sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the shorter (blue) wavelengths of the visible spectrum scatter more than the longer ones. During sunrise and sunset, when light travels a longer path through the atmosphere, the scattering of shorter wavelengths is more pronounced, contributing to the colorful hues of the sky.</li>
                <li><strong>Mie scattering:</strong> Mie scattering takes place when particles are approximately the same size as the wavelength of the radiation. Common causes of Mie scattering include dust, pollen, smoke, and water vapor. Unlike Rayleigh scattering, Mie scattering impacts longer wavelengths. It is prevalent in the lower atmosphere where larger particles are more abundant, and it becomes dominant under overcast cloud conditions.</li>
                <li><strong>Nonselective scattering:</strong> The last significant scattering mechanism is known as nonselective scattering. This occurs when particles are considerably larger than the wavelength of the radiation, typically observed with water droplets and large dust particles. Nonselective scattering earns its name because it scatters all wavelengths roughly equally. Consequently, this type of scattering is responsible for the white appearance of fog and clouds to our eyes, as blue, green, and red light are scattered in approximately equal amounts, resulting in a combination that appears as white light.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
        
            <li><strong>Absorption:</strong> Absorption represents another primary mechanism in the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with the atmosphere. Unlike scattering, this process involves molecules in the atmosphere absorbing energy across different wavelengths. Ozone, carbon dioxide, and water vapor are the three primary atmospheric constituents responsible for this radiation absorption phenomenon.
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Ozone:</strong> Ozone plays a crucial role in absorbing the potentially harmful ultraviolet radiation emitted by the sun, shielding most living organisms. The presence of this protective layer in the atmosphere prevents skin damage that would occur if exposed to sunlight without it.</li>
                <li><strong>Carbon dioxide (greenhouse gas):</strong> Carbon dioxide is often referred to as a greenhouse gas due to its strong absorption of radiation in the far infrared part of the spectrum, particularly associated with thermal heating. This absorption property contributes to trapping heat within the atmosphere. Meanwhile, water vapor in the atmosphere plays a significant role in absorbing both incoming longwave infrared and shortwave microwave radiation, occurring within the range of 22µm to 1m. The presence of water vapor in the lower atmosphere varies significantly based on location and time of year. For instance, air above a desert would contain minimal water vapor, limiting energy absorption, while tropical regions, characterized by high humidity, would have elevated concentrations of water vapor.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These gases have a selective absorption of electromagnetic energy within specific regions of the spectrum, influencing the areas suitable for remote sensing observations. Segments of the spectrum that are minimally affected by atmospheric absorption, making them valuable for remote sensors, are termed "atmospheric windows." By comparing the characteristics of the two primary energy sources, the sun and the Earth, with available atmospheric windows, we can identify wavelengths most effectively used for remote sensing.</p>
              <p>The visible spectrum, aligned with the peak energy level of the sun and matching our eyes' sensitivity, corresponds to an atmospheric window. Additionally, the thermal infrared region around 10 µm is a window for the Earth's emitted heat energy, while wavelengths beyond 1 mm create a substantial window in the microwave region.</p>
              <p>Now that we comprehend the intricate journey of electromagnetic energy from its source to the surface, the next exploration involves understanding the fate of this radiation upon reaching the Earth's surface.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        
          <li><strong>Radiation - Target Interactions:</strong> Radiation that is not absorbed or scattered in the atmosphere can reach and interact with the Earth's surface. There are three forms of interaction that can take place when energy strikes or is incident upon the surface:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Absorption (A):</strong> Absorption occurs when radiation (energy) is absorbed into the target.</li>
              <li><strong>Transmission (T):</strong> Transmission occurs when radiation (energy) passes through a target.</li>
              <li><strong>Reflection (R):</strong> Reflection occurs when radiation "bounces" off the target and is redirected.</li>
            </ul>
            <figure style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="assets/img/remote-sensing/reflectance-radiation-transmission.png" alt="" style="max-width: 60%; max-height: 60%;">
              <figcaption style="text-align: center;"><strong>Image credit:</strong> <a href="https://www.nv5geospatialsoftware.com/What-is-Remote-Sensing" target="_blank"> © nv5geospatialsoftware, All Rights Reserved.</a></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>The total incident energy will interact with the surface in one or more of these three ways. The proportions of each will depend on the wavelength of the energy and the material and condition of the feature. In remote sensing, we are most interested in measuring the radiation reflected from targets. Reflection may occur in two main ways:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Specular reflection:</strong> When a surface is smooth, we get specular or mirror-like reflection where all (or almost all) of the energy is directed away from the surface in a single direction.</li>
              <li><strong>Diffuse reflection:</strong> Diffuse reflection occurs when the surface is rough and the energy is reflected almost uniformly in all directions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most earth surface features lie somewhere between perfectly specular or perfectly diffuse reflectors. If the wavelengths are much smaller than the surface variations or the particle sizes that make up the surface, diffuse reflection will dominate. For example, fine-grained sand would appear fairly smooth to long-wavelength microwaves but would appear quite rough to the visible wavelengths.</p>
            <figure style="text-align: center;">
              <img src="assets/img/remote-sensing/radiation-target.png" alt="" style="max-width: 90%; max-height: 90%;">

            </figure>
          </li>
        
          <p><strong>For example:</strong> Just like the atmosphere, different features on the landscape absorb and reflect electromagnetic radiation differently, and these differences allow us to map the Earth’s surface.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Green vegetation:</strong> Leaves contain a chemical compound called chlorophyll, which strongly absorbs radiation in the red and blue wavelengths while reflecting green wavelengths. During summer, when chlorophyll content is at its peak, leaves appear their greenest. In autumn, with reduced chlorophyll, there's less absorption and more reflection of red wavelengths, causing leaves to appear red or yellow (yellow being a combination of red and green wavelengths). Healthy leaves' internal structure acts as excellent diffuse reflectors of near-infrared wavelengths. While our eyes perceive trees as normal, if sensitive to near-infrared, they would appear extremely bright. Monitoring near-IR reflectance is a method for scientists to assess the health of vegetation.</li>
            <li><strong>Water:</strong> Water tends to absorb longer wavelengths, leading to minimal reflection. It appears dark, particularly in near-infrared wavelengths, helping to distinguish it from other land features. However, the reflectance of water varies with the composition, with clearer water appearing darker than muddy or sediment-laden water. Water's reflectance also increases with the presence of waves and foam. Reflectance in the visible region increases with turbidity and presence of organic matter, while in the near-IR, water strongly absorbs and reflects almost no energy, resulting in a dark appearance. Turbid water with significant suspended matter reflects more visible light.</li>

      <ul style="margin-left: 30px;">
        <li><strong>What are the different types of remote sensing?</strong></li>
          <p>Active and passive remote sensing are two fundamental approaches to acquiring information about objects or the environment from a distance. They differ in how they interact with and obtain data from the target.</p>

          <br>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Active Remote Sensing: </strong>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition: </strong>In active remote sensing, an external source of energy, usually provided by the sensor system itself, is used to illuminate the target, and the sensor measures the reflected or emitted energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Source: </strong>The system actively emits pulses of energy (e.g., radar, lidar, or sonar).
                  <ul>
                    <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
                    <li>Radar: Uses radio waves to detect and measure the distance to targets.</li>
                    <li>Lidar: Uses laser light to measure distances and create detailed 3D maps.</li>
                    <li>Sonar: Used underwater to detect and locate objects using sound waves.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Interaction: </strong>The energy interacts with the target, and the sensor measures the reflected or backscattered energy.</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages: </strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Independent of external illumination (works day or night)</li>
                    <li>Useful for penetrating clouds and vegetation.</li>
                    <li>Provides distance or range information.</li>

                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Passive Remote Sensing: </strong>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition: </strong>In passive remote sensing, the sensor relies on the natural radiation emitted or reflected by the target. It does not emit its own energy source.</li>
                <li><strong>Energy Source: </strong>The sensor captures the naturally occurring radiation from the sun or other sources.
                  <ul>
                    <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
                    <li>Optical sensors: Capture reflected sunlight to create images in the visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared spectra.</li>
                    <li>Infrared sensors: Measure the heat emitted by objects.</li>
                    <li>Radio and microwave sensors: Capture naturally occurring emissions for various applications.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Interaction: </strong> The target emits or reflects energy, and the sensor measures this without actively illuminating the target.</li>
                <li><strong>Advantages: </strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Simplicity in design and operation.</li>
                    <li>Lower cost and power requirements.</li>
                    <li>Good for capturing detailed spectral information.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Both active and passive remote sensing techniques have unique advantages and applications. The choice between them depends on the specific goals of a remote sensing mission and the characteristics of the target and surrounding environment</p>
