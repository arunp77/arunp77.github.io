                    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction </h2>
                    <strong>Magnetogenesis</strong> refers to the generation of cosmic magnetic fields, which may have originated during the early universe. These magnetic fields, observed in galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the intergalactic medium, could be the remnants of primordial magnetic fields produced during various cosmological epochs, such as inflation, phase transitions, or during baryogenesis.

                    <h4 id="maxwell">Maxwell's Equations in an Expanding Universe</h4>
                    In cosmology, the Maxwell equations, which govern electromagnetic fields, must be adapted for an expanding universe. The metric for an isotropic and homogeneous universe is the <b>Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker (FLRW)</b> metric, written as:

                    \[
                    ds^2 = -dt^2 + a(t)^2 \left( dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 \right)
                    \]
                    
                    Where \( a(t) \) is the scale factor of the universe. The Maxwell equations in curved space-time, under this metric, are:

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Gauss's law:</strong>
                            \[
                            \nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = 4\pi \rho_e
                            \]
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Ampère's law: </strong>
                            \[
                            \nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \frac{1}{a} \left( 4\pi \mathbf{J} + \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \right)
                            \]
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Faraday's law: </strong>
                            \[
                            \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
                            \]
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>No magnetic monopoles: </strong>
                            \[
                            \nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
                            \]
                        </li>
                    </ul> 
                    Here, \( \mathbf{E} \) and \( \mathbf{B} \) are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively, and \( \mathbf{J} \) is the current density.


                    <h4 id="generation">Generation of Primordial Magnetic Fields</h4>
                    Magnetic fields can be generated by various mechanisms, including quantum fluctuations during inflation, phase transitions, or vorticity in the plasma. Each mechanism involves different mathematical formalisms:

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Magnetogenesis During Inflation: </strong>During inflation, quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field can be stretched to cosmological scales. However, since the electromagnetic field is conformally invariant, no magnetic field is generated in the standard model. To overcome this, models of inflationary magnetogenesis break conformal invariance, often by coupling the electromagnetic field to a scalar field (such as the inflaton) via the interaction term:
                            \[
                            S_{\text{EM}} = - \frac{1}{4} \int d^4 x \sqrt{-g} \, I(\phi) F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu}
                            \]
                            
                            Where:
                            <ul>
                                <li>\( I(\phi) \) is a coupling function dependent on the inflaton field \( \phi \).</li>
                                <li>\( F_{\mu \nu} \) is the electromagnetic field tensor.</li>
                            </ul>
                            By choosing a time-varying coupling \( I(\phi) \), the equation of motion for the electromagnetic field becomes:
                            \[
                            \frac{d}{dt} \left( a^2 I(\phi) \mathbf{E} \right) = -\frac{\nabla \times \mathbf{B}}{a^2}
                            \]
                            This breaking of conformal symmetry leads to amplification of magnetic fields during inflation, with the strength depending on the coupling function \( I(\phi) \) and the inflationary dynamics.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Magnetogenesis from Cosmological Phase Transitions: </strong> Phase transitions in the early universe, such as the electroweak (EW) or quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transitions, can also generate magnetic fields. These transitions often involve the formation of topological defects (like cosmic strings or domain walls), which can seed magnetic fields.
                        <p>During a phase transition, <b>magnetic helicity</b> and turbulence can play crucial roles in amplifying fields. The evolution of the magnetic field in a turbulent plasma is governed by the <b>magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations</b>:</p>
                        \[
                        \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = \nabla \times \left( \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} - \eta \nabla \times \mathbf{B} \right)
                        \]
                        
                        Where:
                        <ul>
                            <li>\( \mathbf{v} \) is the velocity field of the plasma,</li>
                            <li>\( \eta \) is the magnetic diffusivity.</li>
                        </ul>
                        In the absence of significant diffusion (\( \eta \rightarrow 0 \)), the magnetic field lines are "frozen" into the plasma, and magnetic energy can be amplified by plasma motions. The strength of the generated fields depends on the temperature and energy scale of the phase transition.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Magnetogenesis Through Baryogenesis: </strong>Magnetic fields can also arise during baryogenesis, particularly in scenarios where baryon asymmetry is generated through chiral processes. In such models, the <b>chiral anomaly</b> introduces an additional source of magnetic field amplification.
                        <p>The anomaly equation for the chiral current \( J_5^\mu \) is:</p>
                        \[
                        \partial_\mu J_5^\mu = \frac{e^2}{16\pi^2} F_{\mu \nu} \tilde{F}^{\mu \nu}
                        \]
                        
                        Where \( \tilde{F}^{\mu \nu} \) is the dual of the electromagnetic field tensor. This anomaly can induce a current \( \mathbf{J}_5 \), which modifies the MHD equations to include a <b>chiral magnetic term</b>:
                        \[
                        \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = \nabla \times \left( \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} - \eta \nabla \times \mathbf{B} + \mathbf{J}_5 \right)
                        \]
                        This can amplify magnetic fields in the presence of a non-zero chiral asymmetry. Such processes can generate fields during baryogenesis, typically at energy scales close to the electroweak scale.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h3 id="evolution">Evolution of Magnetic Fields</h3>
                    Once generated, magnetic fields evolve under the influence of cosmic expansion and MHD effects. The evolution of the comoving magnetic field \( \mathbf{B}_c = a^2 \mathbf{B} \) is governed by the induction equation:
                        \[
                        \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}_c}{\partial t} = \nabla \times \left( \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B}_c - \eta \nabla \times \mathbf{B}_c \right)
                        \]
                        The magnetic field can decay, grow, or remain constant depending on the balance between the dynamo effect (amplification due to plasma flows) and resistive decay (due to magnetic diffusivity).
                    
                    <h5>Magnetic Field Scaling: </h5>
                    For large-scale fields, in a universe with turbulence and negligible dissipation, the magnetic field scales as:
                        \[
                        B(z) \propto (1+z)^2
                        \]
                        This shows that magnetic fields get diluted by the expansion of the universe. However, MHD turbulence or a cosmic dynamo could counteract this dilution by amplifying the fields on large scales.
                    
                    <h4 id="constarints">Magnetic Field Constraints </h4>
                    Primordial magnetic fields leave signatures in various observables, such as the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and large-scale structure formation. The power spectrum of primordial magnetic fields \( P_B(k) \) is often modeled as a power law:

                        \[
                        P_B(k) = A_B k^n
                        \]
                    where:
                    <ul>
                        <li>\( A_B \) is the amplitude of the magnetic field power spectrum,</li>
                        <li>\( n \) is the spectral index.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Observational constraints from CMB and large-scale structure place bounds on the strength and coherence scale of primordial magnetic fields. Current observations limit the field strength to be less than about \( 10^{-9} \, \text{G} \) on Mpc scales.

                    <h2 id="observations">Observation of magnetic fields</h2>
                    Magnetic fields have been observed on various scales in the universe, from planets and stars to galaxies and galaxy clusters. These observations are critical for understanding the origin of cosmic magnetic fields, their evolution, and the processes that generated them in the early universe (magnetogenesis). Let’s dive into the different types of observations that have been made and how they contribute to our knowledge of magnetic fields in cosmology.
                    
                    <h4 id="mg-galaxies">Magnetic Fields in Galaxies</h4>
                    Magnetic fields in galaxies, like our Milky Way, have been extensively studied. They are typically detected through synchrotron radiation and Faraday rotation measures (RM). Key observations include:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Synchrotron Radiation: </b>Magnetic fields cause relativistic charged particles (such as electrons) to spiral along magnetic field lines, emitting synchrotron radiation. This radiation is observed in the radio spectrum and is a direct indicator of magnetic fields. In galaxies, magnetic fields have typical strengths of about \( 1 - 10 \, \mu G \).
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Milky Way: </b>In our galaxy, the magnetic field is structured with both a regular (coherent) and a random (turbulent) component. The regular field follows the spiral arms, while the random component is associated with turbulent processes in the interstellar medium (ISM).</li>
                                <li><b>External Galaxies: </b>Spiral galaxies like M51 (the Whirlpool Galaxy) show magnetic fields aligned with the spiral arms, detected through synchrotron radiation. This suggests that magnetic fields are involved in galactic structure formation and evolution.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Faraday Rotation: </b>When polarized light from distant radio sources passes through a magnetized plasma, the plane of polarization rotates. This effect, known as Faraday rotation, is proportional to the magnetic field strength and the electron density along the line of sight. The rotation measure (RM) is given by:
                            \[
                            RM \propto \int n_e \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{l}
                            \]
                            
                            Where:
                            <ul>
                                <li>\( n_e \) is the electron density,</li>
                                <li>\( \mathbf{B} \) is the magnetic field along the line of sight,</li>
                                <li>\( d\mathbf{l} \) is the differential element along the line of sight.</li>
                            </ul>
                            Faraday rotation measurements provide information about both the strength and direction of magnetic fields in galaxies and the intergalactic medium.
                        </li>
                    </ol>


                    <h4 id="mg-galaxies-cluster">Magnetic Fields in Galaxy Clusters</h4>
                    Magnetic fields are also observed in galaxy clusters, with typical strengths ranging from \( 0.1 - 10 \, \mu G \). Galaxy clusters are massive structures containing galaxies, hot ionized gas (intracluster medium, or ICM), and dark matter. Observations of magnetic fields in clusters are important because they provide clues about the amplification of primordial magnetic fields through large-scale structure formation.
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Radio Halos and Relics: </b>Galaxy clusters exhibit diffuse radio emission known as <b>radio halos</b> and <b>radio relics</b>, believed to be caused by synchrotron radiation from relativistic electrons interacting with cluster magnetic fields. These large-scale structures can be as large as \( 1 \, \text{Mpc} \) across and indicate the presence of magnetic fields over vast regions.
                            <ul>
                                <li><b>Radio Halos: </b>They are centrally located and are thought to arise from turbulence in the ICM, which reaccelerates relativistic particles. The magnetic fields inferred from radio halos are typically \( 1 - 5 \, \mu G \).</li>
                                <li><b>Radio Relics: </b>These are found at the periphery of clusters and are associated with shock waves caused by cluster mergers. Magnetic fields in radio relics are estimated to be \( 0.1 - 1 \, \mu G \).</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><b>X-Ray Observations of Galaxy Clusters: </b>Galaxy clusters emit X-rays from hot, ionized gas in the ICM. The presence of magnetic fields can influence the thermal pressure and structure of the gas. Observations of the <b>Sunyaev-Zel’dovich (SZ) effect</b> in clusters (interaction between CMB photons and hot gas) can also provide constraints on the magnetic field strength in these environments.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <h4 id="igm">Magnetic Fields in the Intergalactic Medium (IGM)</h4>
                    One of the most intriguing areas of magnetic field research is the detection of magnetic fields in the <b>intergalactic medium (IGM)</b>, the space between galaxies. Observations suggest that magnetic fields may exist in the IGM, potentially as remnants of primordial magnetic fields generated in the early universe.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Upper Limits on IGM Fields: </b>Using techniques like <b>blazar observations</b>, upper limits have been placed on magnetic fields in the IGM. Blazars are active galactic nuclei that emit high-energy gamma rays. If these gamma rays interact with the extragalactic background light, they produce electron-positron pairs, which subsequently emit secondary gamma rays through inverse Compton scattering. The presence of an IGM magnetic field can deflect the electron-positron pairs, suppressing the secondary gamma ray emission. By comparing the observed gamma ray flux from blazars, constraints on IGM magnetic fields have been derived. These observations have placed upper limits on the magnetic field strength in the IGM, typically around:
                            
                            \[
                            B_{\text{IGM}} \lesssim 10^{-16} \, \text{G}
                            \]

                        This suggests that, if primordial magnetic fields were generated, they have been significantly diluted by the expansion of the universe or are very weak on large scales.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Faraday Rotation in the IGM: </b>Faraday rotation measurements through the IGM have also provided constraints on the presence of magnetic fields. However, since the electron density in the IGM is low, the Faraday rotation signal is weak, and stronger constraints are challenging to obtain.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 id="cmb">Magnetic Fields in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)</h4>
                    The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) offers another avenue to study primordial magnetic fields. Magnetic fields in the early universe could leave imprints on the CMB through several mechanisms:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>CMB Polarization:</b> Primordial magnetic fields can affect the polarization of the CMB through <b>Faraday rotation</b> of the CMB photons as they travel through a magnetized plasma. This rotation would modify the angular power spectrum of the CMB’s <b>E-mode</b> and <b>B-mode</b> polarization, potentially providing evidence of magnetic fields at early times.</li>

                        <li><b>Scalar and Vector Modes:</b> Magnetic fields generate both scalar and vector perturbations in the early universe, leading to anisotropies in the CMB. These perturbations can affect the temperature and polarization power spectra, allowing for constraints on the strength and structure of primordial magnetic fields.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Current CMB data, including from the <b>Planck satellite</b>, have placed upper limits on the strength of primordial magnetic fields, typically around:

                    \[
                    B_{\text{primordial}} \lesssim 10^{-9} \, \text{G} \, \text{on Mpc scales}
                    \]

                    <h4 id="large-scale">Large-Scale Structure and Magnetic Fields</h4>
                    The large-scale structure of the universe, including galaxies, filaments, and voids, provides indirect evidence for cosmic magnetic fields. Magnetic fields could influence the formation and evolution of these structures by altering the dynamics of the baryonic matter.
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Cosmic Filaments: </b>Magnetic fields are believed to exist in the filaments connecting galaxy clusters. These fields can be detected through synchrotron emission or Faraday rotation.</li>
                        <li><b>Structure Formation: </b>Magnetic fields may also play a role in the collapse of gas into galaxies and galaxy clusters. During the gravitational collapse, magnetic fields can be amplified through <b>magnetic dynamo mechanisms</b>.</li>
                    </ul>

                    In conclusion, the observations of cosmic magnetic fields span a wide range of scales, from galaxies and clusters to the intergalactic medium and the cosmic microwave background. These fields provide clues about their origin, with several key points:
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Magnetic fields in galaxies: </b>Strong and well-ordered fields are seen in galaxies, with evidence for both primordial and dynamo amplification processes.</li>
                        <li><b>Magnetic fields in galaxy clusters: </b>Diffuse radio halos and relics in clusters indicate large-scale magnetic fields, possibly enhanced by cluster mergers and turbulence.</li>
                        <li><b>IGM and CMB constraints: </b>Upper limits on magnetic fields in the intergalactic medium and the CMB place stringent constraints on the strength of primordial magnetic fields, providing insight into the possible mechanisms of magnetogenesis.</li>
                    </ol>

                    These observations support the idea that magnetic fields could have been generated in the early universe and subsequently amplified through astrophysical processes such as turbulence and dynamos. They also motivate further study into the mathematical models of magnetogenesis and the observational techniques needed to detect primordial magnetic fields.

                    <h2 id="measurments">Measurement of Magnetic Fields</h2>
                    Magnetic fields in cosmic environments, such as galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the intergalactic medium, are measured through several observational techniques. These measurements are primarily indirect, relying on the interactions between magnetic fields and charged particles or electromagnetic radiation. Below is a detailed explanation of how these magnetic fields are measured using key mathematical equations.
                    <ol>
                        <li id="rotation"><strong>Faraday Rotation: </strong>Faraday Rotation is one of the most common methods for measuring magnetic fields in space. It occurs when polarized electromagnetic radiation (usually from radio sources such as quasars) passes through a magnetized plasma. The magnetic field causes the plane of polarization to rotate, and this rotation is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field along the line of sight, as well as the electron density.
                        The Rotation Measure (RM) quantifies the amount of this rotation and is given by:

                            \[
                            RM = 0.81 \int_0^L n_e(z) B_{\parallel}(z) \, dz
                            \]
                            
                        Where:
                        <ul>
                            <li>\( RM \) is the rotation measure in units of \(\text{rad}/\text{m}^2\)</li>
                            <li>\( n_e(z) \) is the electron density in \(\text{cm}^3\)</li>
                            <li>\( B_{\parallel}(z) \) is the magnetic field component along the line of sight in \(\mu\) G</li>
                            <li>\( z \) is the position along the line of sight in pc (parsecs), and \( L \) is the distance to the source.</li>
                        </ul>
                        The angle of polarization rotation \( \Delta \theta \) is related to the RM and the wavelength \( \lambda \) of the radiation by the equation:

                        \[
                        \Delta \theta = RM \cdot \lambda^2
                        \]
                        
                        Thus, the rotation angle \( \Delta \theta \) depends on the wavelength of the radiation, and measuring \( \Delta \theta \) at different wavelengths allows astronomers to calculate the RM. Once the RM is known, the magnetic field strength along the line of sight can be determined, provided the electron density \( n_e \) is estimated from other observations (e.g., X-ray observations of the hot gas in galaxy clusters).
                        <p><strong>Data Source:</strong> Radio telescopes like the Very Large Array (VLA), LOFAR, and ASKAP are used for Faraday Rotation studies. RM grids are constructed using observations of polarized radio emissions from extragalactic sources.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key points: </strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Faraday Rotation</b> is sensitive to the magnetic field component along the line of sight \( B_{\parallel} \).</li>
                            <li>The RM integrates the product of the magnetic field and the electron density along the line of sight.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        </li>
                        <li id="synchrotron"><strong>Synchrotron Radiation: </strong>Synchrotron radiation is produced when relativistic electrons (electrons moving at nearly the speed of light) spiral around magnetic field lines. The radiation is emitted in the radio spectrum and is polarized, making it a useful tool for measuring both the strength and structure of magnetic fields.

                            The total synchrotron power emitted by a relativistic electron spiraling in a magnetic field is given by:
                            
                            \[
                            P_{\text{synch}} \propto N_e B_{\perp}^{1.5} \nu^{-0.5}
                            \]
                            
                            Where:
                            <ul>
                                <li>\( P_{\text{synch}} \) is the synchrotron power.</li>
                                <li>\( N_e \) is the number density of relativistic electrons.</li>
                                <li>\( B_{\perp} \) is the magnetic field component perpendicular to the line of sight.</li>
                                <li>\( \nu \) is the frequency of the emitted radiation.</li>
                            </ul>
                            The synchrotron power depends on both the electron density and the magnetic field strength. By observing the radio flux at different frequencies, one can estimate the magnetic field strength, assuming a model for the electron population.

                            <p>The synchrotron emission spectrum follows a power law:</p>

                            \[
                            I(\nu) \propto \nu^{-\alpha}
                            \]
                            
                            Where \( \alpha \) is the spectral index, typically in the range \( 0.5 - 1 \) for cosmic sources. From the synchrotron spectrum, we can derive the spectral index, which gives insights into the energy distribution of relativistic electrons and the magnetic field strength.
                            <p><strong>Polarized Synchrotron Emission: </strong></p>
                            In addition to the total synchrotron power, synchrotron emission is partially polarized, and the degree of polarization can give information about the ordering of the magnetic field:

                            \[

This effect can be used to directly measure the strength of magnetic fields, particularly in molecular clouds and star-forming regions.
                        <p>The energy shift due to the Zeeman effect is proportional to the magnetic field strength:</p>

                        \[

                            In terms of frequency shift, the splitting of a spectral line is given by:

                            <p>Where \( h \) is Planck’s constant. By measuring the frequency shift \( \Delta \nu \) in the spectral line, the magnetic field strength \( B \) can be directly determined.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Zeeman effect is particularly useful for measuring line-of-sight magnetic fields in dense regions, such as molecular clouds where strong magnetic fields are present.</p>

As CMB photons pass through magnetized regions, their polarization plane can be rotated due to Faraday rotation, similar to the effect on radio waves. The Faraday rotation angle for CMB photons is given by:
                            \[
                            \Delta \theta_{\text{CMB}} = \frac{e^3}{2 \pi m_e^2} \int n_e(z) B_{\parallel}(z) \frac{\lambda^2}{a^2(z)} dz

                            Where:
                            <ul>
                                <li>\( e \) is the electron charge.</li>
                                <li>\( m_e \) is the electron mass.</li>

                            </ul>
                            This equation shows that the rotation angle depends on the magnetic field strength along the line of sight, the electron density, and the wavelength of the CMB photons. Measuring this rotation requires extremely sensitive polarization measurements of the CMB, which can provide constraints on the strength of primordial magnetic fields.
                            <p><strong>Data Source: </strong>CMB experiments such as Planck and BICEP2 aim to detect B-mode polarization, which could be related to primordial magnetic fields.</p>

Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations govern the behavior of such magnetized plasmas:

                            \frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = \nabla \times (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B} - \eta \nabla \times \mathbf{B})

                            In the limit of low diffusivity (\( \eta \approx 0 \)), magnetic field lines are "frozen" into the plasma, and turbulent motions can amplify the magnetic field. Observing turbulence in galaxy clusters and filaments can provide insights into how magnetic fields evolve and amplify on large scales.

                  The strength and structure of cosmic magnetic fields are measured through a combination of techniques, including Faraday rotation, synchrotron radiation, the Zeeman effect, and CMB polarization. Each method relies on mathematical relationships between the magnetic field and the observed radiation or particle dynamics, allowing astronomers to infer magnetic field properties across a wide range of cosmic environments.
